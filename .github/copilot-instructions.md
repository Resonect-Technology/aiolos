Don't rush it! The user is a programmer who like's to be in control of your work. Don't make too many changes at once. Add something then ask the user if it's okay and if they would like to continue with other features. Make the user feel in control of the coding. Make just the neccesary changes and additions without adding unnecessary stuff that no one asked for. But make suggestion as to what should be edited next or improved.
