# Aiolos Weather Station Firmware Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Aiolos Weather Station firmware. The firmware powers a solar/battery-operated weather station based on the LilyGO T-SIM7000G board (ESP32 + SIM7000G cellular modem). The station collects environmental data (temperature, wind speed/direction) and transmits it to a backend server using HTTP POST requests. The system is designed for remote deployment with power efficiency and reliability as key concerns.

The firmware represents a complete redesign of an older MQTT-based weather station firmware, transitioning to a simple HTTP protocol for improved compatibility and easier backend integration. This redesign emphasizes modularity, clear separation of concerns, and robust error handling to ensure the station can operate autonomously for extended periods in remote locations.
